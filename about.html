<h1>About me:</h1>
<p>
    I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate student currently pursuing my B.Tech at VSSUT, batch 2021 to 2025.<br/> Alongside my studies,
    I have ventured into web development, acquiring skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites,<br/>
    I am eager to expand my knowledge and explore back-end development technologies. With a solid foundation in front-end development,
    I aim to bring a unique perspective to web projects by combining my mechanical engineering background with digital innovation.<br/> Motivated by curiosity
    and driven to learn, I am excited to contribute to the ever-evolving world of web development.
